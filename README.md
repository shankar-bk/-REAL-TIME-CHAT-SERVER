## I created a real-time chat backend. The server allows users to connect instantly, join different chat rooms, and send/receive messages live. Each user can join a room, and only users in that room will see the messages. I used Express to set up the server and Socket.IO to handle real-time communication. The system supports multiple chat rooms and shows when users connect or disconnect. It was fully tested on localhost, and the chat works in real time across different browser windows.
